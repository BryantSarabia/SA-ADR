Functional Requirements 

Priority 

 

The system must maintain the virtual model synchronised with live conditions 

Highest 

 

The system must ingest streaming data from all registered sensors and external sources 

 

 

The system must support on-demand and automatic simulations, what-if analysis of interventions and recommend strategies to keep response times to critical services within acceptable thresholds 

Highest 

 

The system must automatically generate alerts when accessibility to critical services drops below threshold and provide suggested mitigation 

Highest 

 

The system must generate alerts when hindered access could delay emergency response 

 

 

Every access to data must be logged in an audit trail 

High 

 

The system must implement RBAC to restrict data access and action authority according to user roles 

High 

 

The system must process incoming updates to track deviations from expected condition 

High 

 

The system must enable edge nodes to operate autonomously and maintain essential functions during network or power disconnection 

High 

 

The system must display a live 2D map showing traffic conditions and availability to critical infrastructure 

High 

 

The system must store simulation results 

High 

 

Data from sensors must be stored for further analysis, visualization or model retraining 

Medium 

 

The system must collect and display sensor health 

Medium 

 

The system must collect external weather data (3rd party APIs) and internal data (weather sensors, hazard sensors) 

Medium 

 

The District Operator must have access to localised simulation results 

Medium 

 

The system will allow simultaneous access for up to 50 operators
